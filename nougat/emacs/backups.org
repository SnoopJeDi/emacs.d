* backups
Backups are created everytime a buffer is saved. This is really useful
for recovering work that takes place between version-control commits
or on unversioned files.

** store backups with the autosaves
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq backup-directory-alist
        `((".*" . ,emacs-autosave-directory)))
#+END_SRC

** keep 10 backups
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq kept-new-versions 10
        kept-old-verisons 0)
#+END_SRC

** delete old backups
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq delete-old-versions t)
#+END_SRC

** copy files to avoid various problems
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq backup-by-copying t)
#+END_SRC

** backup files even if version controlled
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq vc-make-backup-files t)
#+END_SRC

** backup every save
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package backup-each-save
    :config (add-hook 'after-save-hook 'backup-each-save))
#+END_SRC
