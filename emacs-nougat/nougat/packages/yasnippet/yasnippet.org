* YASnippet
YASnippet extends org-mode '<s'-like templating in an arbitrary way.  This is useful
for quickly applying export settings, annotating code blocks, and the like.

This assumes that snippets are stored or symlinked to =${HOME}/.emacs.d/snippets/*=
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package yasnippet)
(setq yas-snippet-dirs
      (list (concat (file-name-as-directory user-emacs-directory) (file-name-as-directory "emacs-nougat") "snippets"))
)

(yas-global-mode 1) ;; or M-x yas-reload-all if you've started YASnippet already.
(setq yas-triggers-in-field t) ;; allow nested snippets
#+end_src
