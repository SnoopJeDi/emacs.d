** shift-tab
Sometimes it's handy to go back exactly a tab width.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(global-set-key (kbd "<S-tab>") 'un-indent-by-tab-width)
(defun un-indent-by-tab-width ()
  "remove 4 spaces from beginning of of line"
  (interactive)
  (save-excursion
    (save-match-data
      (beginning-of-line)
      ;; get rid of tabs at beginning of line
      (when (looking-at "^\\s-+")
        (untabify (match-beginning 0) (match-end 0)))
      (when (concat "^" (make-string tab-width ?\ ))
        (replace-match "")))))
