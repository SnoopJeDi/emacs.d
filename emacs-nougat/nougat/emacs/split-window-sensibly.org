** split window sensibly
From [[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23659909/reverse-evaluation-order-of-split-height-threshold-and-split-width-threshold-in][SO]], this is a way to prefer vertical splits over horizontal ones depending on
window size.

             (with-selected-window window
               (split-window-right)))
        (and (window-splittable-p window)
             ;; Split window vertically.

               (split-window-below)))

             (not (window-minibuffer-p window))

             ;; the value of `split-width-threshold'.

                 (with-selected-window window
                   (split-window-right))))))))
